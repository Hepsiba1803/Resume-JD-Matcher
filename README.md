# 🚀 Resume-JD Matcher

An open-source, collaborative-ready platform that helps job seekers and recruiters **quickly compare resumes and job descriptions**, highlighting keyword matches and gaps. The tool is designed for both learning and team-style software development, and simulates modern **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** workflows.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Enable job seekers to tailor their resumes effectively and help recruiters instantly screen candidates by:
- Extracting and comparing key skills, experiences, and requirements.
- Visualizing overlap, missing terms, and ATS-friendliness in an interactive report.

---

## 👥 Stakeholders & Vision

- **Primary:** Developers, job seekers, recruiters  
- **Future:** Open-source contributors and collaborators  

**Vision:**  
Create an intuitive, modular, and scalable platform for resume-JD matching that promotes team best practices and practical job search support.

---

## ✨ Features

- **File Upload:** Resume & job description (PDF, DOCX, TXT)  
- **Text Extraction:** Automatic parsing to extract core text from files  
- **Keyword Extraction:** NLP-based identification of essential skills and phrases  
- **Similarity Scoring:** Smart scoring based on keyword overlap and relevance  
- **Results Visualization:** Clear highlighting of matches, gaps, and strengths  
- **ATS Analysis:** Checks for ATS-relevant features and offers suggestions  
- **Extensible Codebase:** Modular design, easy to expand or contribute  

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Upload** your resume and the target job description using the simple UI.  
2. **Parsing & Extraction:** The backend extracts and cleanses text from both files.  
3. **Keyword Matching:** NLP and similarity algorithms match skills, experiences, and terms.  
4. **Actionable Report:** See overlapping keywords, missing important terms, and tips for ATS optimization.
