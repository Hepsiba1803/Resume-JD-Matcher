# Resume-JD Matcher

A collaborative-ready, open-source tool to help job seekers and recruiters compare resumes with job descriptions, highlighting matches and gaps. Built to simulate modern Applicant Tracking System (ATS) workflows, this project is perfect for learning both solo and team-based software development.

## üöÄ Features

- Upload and parse resume and job description files
- Automatic keyword extraction and similarity scoring
- Highlights matching and missing keywords
- ATS-friendly analysis and suggestions for improvement
- Modular, extensible codebase designed for collaboration

## üìö How It Works

1. **Upload** your resume and target job description.
2. The system **parses** both documents, extracting key skills and terms.
3. **Keyword matching** and **semantic similarity** algorithms compare your resume to the job description.
4. Get an **analysis report** showing:
   - Overlapping keywords and skills
   - Missing important terms
   - Suggestions to improve your resume for ATS systems

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features

- Resume and JD File Upload: Users can upload their resume and a job description (PDF, DOCX, or TXT).
- Text Extraction: The system extracts text from both files for analysis.
- Keyword Extraction: Automatic identification of key skills and terms from both documents.
- Similarity Scoring: Calculates and displays a similarity score based on keyword overlap and relevance.
- Results Display: Highlights matching and missing keywords, and provides a summary report.
- Basic User Interface: Simple web interface for file upload and results visualization.
