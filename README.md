# Resume-JD Matcher

A collaborative-ready, open-source tool to help job seekers and recruiters compare resumes with job descriptions, highlighting matches and gaps. Built to simulate modern Applicant Tracking System (ATS) workflows, this project is perfect for learning both solo and team-based software development.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload and parse resume and job description files
- Automatic keyword extraction and similarity scoring
- Highlights matching and missing keywords
- ATS-friendly analysis and suggestions for improvement
- Modular, extensible codebase designed for collaboration

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Upload** your resume and target job description.
2. The system **parses** both documents, extracting key skills and terms.
3. **Keyword matching** and **semantic similarity** algorithms compare your resume to the job description.
4. Get an **analysis report** showing:
   - Overlapping keywords and skills
   - Missing important terms
   - Suggestions to improve your resume for ATS systems
