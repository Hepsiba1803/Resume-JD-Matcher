# Backend Development Plan

This document outlines the backend architecture, technologies, and step-by-step development roadmap for the Resume-JD Matcher project.

---

## Goals

- Enable users to upload resumes and job descriptions (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Extract and process text from uploaded files
- Perform keyword extraction and similarity scoring
- Provide an API for the frontend to interact with the backend

---

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Framework:** FastAPI (recommended for rapid API development)
- **File Parsing:** PyPDF2, python-docx, built-in open/read for TXT
- **NLP/Keyword Extraction:** spaCy, scikit-learn
- **Testing:** pytest
- **Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI (auto-generated by FastAPI)
- **Database (optional for MVP):** SQLite or in-memory storage (upgradeable to PostgreSQL/MongoDB)

## Development Roadmap

### 1. Project Setup

- [ ] Initialize FastAPI project
- [ ] Set up basic routing and health check endpoint
- [ ] Add CORS middleware for frontend integration

### 2. File Upload Endpoint

- [ ] Implement `/upload` endpoint to accept resume and JD files
- [ ] Validate file types and size (PDF, DOCX, TXT, <=5MB)
- [ ] Save files temporarily for processing

### 3. Text Extraction

- [ ] Use PyPDF2 for PDF parsing
- [ ] Use python-docx for DOCX parsing
- [ ] Use built-in open/read for TXT files
- [ ] Normalize and clean extracted text

### 4. Keyword Extraction & Similarity Scoring

- [ ] Use spaCy to extract key skills/terms
- [ ] Use scikit-learn (TF-IDF, cosine similarity) to compare resume and JD
- [ ] Return a similarity score and list of matched/missing keywords

### 5. API Response & Error Handling

- [ ] Design clear API responses (success, error, validation)
- [ ] Handle parsing errors gracefully

### 6. Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for file upload and parsing
- [ ] Write tests for keyword extraction and scoring

### 7. Documentation

- [ ] Document all endpoints using FastAPI’s auto-generated docs (Swagger UI)
- [ ] Add usage examples and expected responses

---

## Milestones & Timeline

- **June 18:** FastAPI setup, file upload endpoint
- **June 19:** File parsing, text extraction, initial keyword extraction
- **June 20:** Similarity scoring, API responses, testing, and documentation
